## Hi there 👋

I have exprience as a customer success executive in a fintech Saas company where I focus on understanding customer needs, improving onboarding, and ensuring product adoption and retention. I also worked as a product design intern before that. My combined background helps me see the product from both sides: how it is built and how it is experienced.

Recently, I’ve been diving into data — learning how to gather, analyze, and visualize information to take business decisions.

I like breaking things down to understand how they are build & work. Love to learn about almost everything. I’m passionate about technology, wisdom, health, and books. Outside of work, I enjoy long runs that clear my mind and push the limits of endurance and thought.<br><br>
